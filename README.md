# preprocessing_emojis
Scripts to preprocess text data that includes emojis and other special characters.

## Goal
Preprocess text data, mostly tweets, that includes **emojis** and other special characters, e.g. **dingbats** or **Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols**. I started to do so for text classification, but it can be used for a variety of text mining issues, including all the fancy low level stuff like *wordclouds* or *term frequencies*
